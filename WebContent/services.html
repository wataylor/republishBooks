<img align=left src="images/bigbook.gif" alt="[Take a while to do this one...]">

<p>Perennity Publishing values printed material of any kind; we treat your materails with the care and respect they deserve.</p>

<p>All materials are sent by courier service such as UPS or Federal Express.  For rare or valuable books, insurance can be purchased to any requested amount for an additional charge.</p>

<p>The scanning process is non-invasive and non-destructive; however, extremely old or rare manuscripts which would be harmed by handling should not be submitted.  All original copies will be returned with no damage other than the wear one would expect from an ordinary reading.</p>

<p>The process should be expected to take up to 4 months, however, &quot;rush&quot; service may be obtained for an additional charge.  Since each page is individually scanned and each book is carefully proofread for anyscanning or typographical errors, a certain amount of time is unavoidable.  It is not uncommon for the republished version of the book to be more accurate than the original, thanks to modern spell-checking and thorough proofreading.</p>

<h2>Pricing</h2>

<p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> These prices are retail prices for republishing ONE book.  If you have larger quantities, there are significant economies of scale, and we can offer you much lower pricing in volume.  Please <a href="javascript:location.href='contact.jsp'+sessionIDsuff">contact us</a> for more information.</p>

<table border=1 cellpadding=3 align=center>

<tr><td>Per-page charge</td><td>$2 per page; $4 per page if in poor condition</td></tr>

<tr><td>Per-image charge</td><td>$10 per image</td></tr>

<tr><td>Cover charge</td><td>$30 for entire outside cover</td></tr>

<tr><td>Flyleaf material (information inside cover, if any)</td><td>$15</td></tr>

<tr><td>Index<br>
This includes an automatic macro so the index will be accurately updated after any pagination change to the file. Each entry is manually marked to the word, so the index will reflect the exact wishes of the author.</td><td>$350 for the first 500 entries, $2 for each entry thereafter</td></tr>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This pricing does not include any charges to the on-demand publisher for actually printing copies of the book.  These fees will provide you with an electronic format of the book as described below.</p>

<p>Graphic charges include all necessary &quot;cleaning up&quot; of graphics; the resulting illustrations will be of professional quality and as close to original quality as possible.  Graphics will be rendered as color or monochrome, as they were in the original book.  Please note that most on-demand printing services are capable of printing cover art in full color, but are NOT capable of printing color in the body of the book.  The electronic file delivered to you WILL be in color as appropriate, so you will be ready for future improvements in printing technology, or for on-line publication.</p>

<p>Books requiring special treatment, such as large numbers of illustrations that do not scan well, may require additional fees.  If we anticipate that a book may require additional fees in excess of 10% of the calculated normal pricing, you will be informed before the work begins.</p>

<p>For your convenience, Perennity Publishing has developed a standard procedure for formatting books while processing them, that should suit most purposes.  These instructions are given to our scanning and proofreading operators; <a href="procrules.html">we have put them here so you can see how your book will be handled.</a></p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>After the process is complete, you will receive:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your book back.  If you do not require the book to be returned, there will be a credit to reflect the savings on return shipping.</li>

<li>A Microsoft Word document containing the entire contents of your book as specified, from title page to index (if required).  This will include a special macro and associated information file to allow for the index and table of contents to be automatically regenerated whenever your editing changes might alter the page number structure.  If you would prefer a format other than Microsoft Word, please <a href="javascript:location.href='contact.jsp'+sessionIDsuff">contact us</a>; we are able to meet your needs.</li>

<li>A PDF file of the contents of the book, suitable for submission to an on-demand publisher.  This file need not be in the original format of the book; it can be to any page dimensions you specify, and with a custom stylesheet using any font you wish to supply.  Otherwise, it will use a standard modern stylesheet and formatted to the standard size closest to the original size of the book.</li>

<li>A PDF file containing the outside cover of the book, suitable for submission to an on-demand publisher for production of a paperback version of the book.  A hard-cover or library binding requires a slightly different file, which can be obtained for a small additional charge.</li>
