<h1>Information for New Customers</h1>

<p>Perennity Publishing provides a cost-effective service to convert printed materials to electronic form and bring them into print.  We take your existing copy of the book and provide you with a fully-editable electronic file containing the entire contents of the book, both text and graphics.  This is not simply an images of each page; it is an electronic file containing format information as if the book had been typed into a computer in the first place.  <a href="what.html">Learn more about our book republishing.</a></p>

<p>We make it affordable for anyone to have a book published or to return an out-of-print book to availability.  <a href="services.html">Learn more about our republishing services and pricing.</a></p>
