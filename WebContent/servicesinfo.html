<h1>Customer Services Information</h1>

<p>As an additional service to our customers, Perennity Publishing provides a sophisticated tracking system so customers can follow the progress of their books as they are scanned, proofread, processed, and shipped.  This also provides a convenient place for the electronic files of the books to be downloaded - no need to wait for them to come in the mail!</p>

<p>For security and to avoid confusion, we ask that you log in first.  That way we won't get mixed up as to whose books are whose.</p>

<p>When preparing to send us books for republishing, you can enter the information about each book here, and create a shipment of any number of books.  You can also add any special instructions for each book.</p>

<p>If we run into any difficulties with a book, we'll post our notes here where you can see them and give us additional information.  That way, all the communications are stored where we can both look at them, so you will get the result you're after.</p>
<form>
<p>Throughout this area, you will find help buttons that look like this: <input type=button value=" ? " onClick="openHelpWindow('<h2 align=center>Help Window</h2><p>When you click on a [?] button, you will get a Help Window giving you information about its associated button or element.</p>')">  These buttons bring up windows with additional information about whatever is nearby.  If you get confused in an area, look for the help buttons and see if they can answer your questions.</p>
</form>
<p>If that's not good enough, you can always <a href="javascript:location.href='contact.jsp'+sessionIDsuff">contact us</a> and we will be glad to help.</p>
